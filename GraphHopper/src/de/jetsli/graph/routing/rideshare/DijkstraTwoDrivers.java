    // Now update the overall shortest path only when all 4 shortest-path-trees (spt's) contain the vertex (from the relaxed edges of the current spt).
    // The breaking condition is different to normal bi-dijkstra - see **
    //
    // The meeting point is M and not N where all 4 spt's have minimal values:
    //         B1
    //
    //          N   B2
    //             M
    //   A1       A2
    //
    // And so the A1-spt needs to reach not only the A2-spt but even the point M
    //  ** break search only
    // if max(A1-shortest-path-tree, A2-spt) + max(B1-spt, B2-spt) + DELTA >= last shortest path

    // But problem regarding the DELTA: distanceA + distanceB can be of very different length. e.g. 7+1==4+4
    // Should we add e.g. the difference of both detours or different of percentage to the distance?
    // E.g. normally tourA is 7. detour is 1, tourB is 10, detour is 5 => DELTA == 4
    // But the DELTA is not monotonically increasing! => we cannot easily break.
    // Hmmh but this is not really working also because the max+max is not really correct

    // And the more I think about it. it is more: max(A1-shortest-path-tree, A2-spt, B1-spt, B2-spt) + DELTA >= last shortest path
    // As the newly discovered point M (from A1-spt) needs old information of the spt's from A2,B1 and B2
    // We can use a heuristical value which assumes the sp of both direct paths are found:
    // break if max(currA1+currA2, currB1+currB2) > 1.1 * max(sp-A,sp-B)
    // => so found only the detour if its at maximum 20% longer then the actual distance.
    // to further improve processing we can break the calculation of B before A if sp-B is smaller than A

    // HA! or just stop the A search alone  if min(currA1, currA2) > personalFactor * sp-A
    //     and the same for the B search    if min(currB1, currB2) > personalFactor * sp-B
    // default is personalFactor=1.1?
    // -> hmmh should this be lower to make it faster? because it is min(currA1, currA2) and not currA1+currA2
